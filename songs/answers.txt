I would probably consider their audio aura to be focused on danceability and energy,
with valence as slightly below average.

The issue with this calculation could be that it doesn't account for the person's
amount of listening; for example, the top song could be listened to 5000 times with
the remaining 99 songs being much lower, but this wouldn't reflect that.
I would give weight to how much a song is listened to relative to others, as well.
