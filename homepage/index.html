            I enjoy playing video games in my spare time, so I figured I would write about one of my favorite genres: Strategy Role Playing Games, or SRPGs for short.
            As the name suggests, they have links to Role Playing Games (such as Pokemon or Final Fantasy), but they have a few distinct attributes to them in comparison.
            Generally speaking, they all take place on a grid, not unlike chess or other wargames. You control individual characters as they fight an opposing army,
            with allies and enemies "taking turns" initiating battles in order to win. These games really test your abilities to both strategize and improvise,
            as most of them contain some element of randomness, like an attack missing or landing a "critical hit" that does double or triple the damage of an attack.
            Further, they retain the character building aspects of RPGs, allowing greater attachment to your characters than a pure strategy game may allow.
            This middleground is incredibly satisfying to me as a player, and in my view, it is the central gameplay appeal of the SRPG.

            However, SRPGs also often provide many opportunities for narrative development that are unlike many other genres. Many of them showcase the effects of war,
            bringing with them all the baggage that may imply. As a result, the genre is generally predisposed to showcasing more mature themes and serious plots.
            Characters often interact with each other outside of battle, reflecting either on their experiences on the battlefield or distracting themselves from it.
            This is all well and good, but not anything out of the ordinary, right? Where SRPGs really shine is in their ability to make you care about the characters,
            sometimes with extremely limited dialogue, by establishing an implied narrative in the individual chapters of gameplay. The swordsman got a critical,
            saving an otherwise doomed attempt? These things build up, and with the addition of randomness, SRPGs often have very unlikely heroes that become memorable.
            The gameplay reinforces the story, and the story (at its best) reinforces the gameplay, leading to strong integration between the two of them.
            This can elevate otherwise unremarkable main plots (which SRPGs have not infrequently) and result in a satisfying story, despite this tendency.

            There are too many SRPG games to talk about, but here are some blurbs for a few of my favorites. Click on the images below for more in-depth descriptions.

            Released in 2016, this is a more modern SRPG that eschews many of the<br>
            genre's usual trappings, like medieval fantasy, and instead embraces sci-fi.<br>
            Focusing less on story and more on gameplay, battles are extremely dynamic and,<br>
            in my opinion, the best the SRPG genre has to offer.<br>
