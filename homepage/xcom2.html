             XCOM 2 is a massive divergence from Fire Emblem, both tonally and in gameplay.
            It emphasizes positioning far more with its Cover mechanic, along with Flanking.
             Cover reduces the chance to be hit by enemies, and Flanking increases it along
                   with vastly increasing the chance for a critical blow to be dealt
                 It revolves around a cast of rebels trying to fight an alien invasion,
               but frankly, the story is very filler and takes a backseat to the gameplay.
               Now, try to guess: Which of these is NOT an alien that you fight in XCOM 2?
