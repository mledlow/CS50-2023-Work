        <pre>
            Triangle Strategy is more similar to Fire Emblem than XCOM 2,
            but it largely draws inspiration from the Ogre Battle series.
              Particularly, it is very similar to Tactics Ogre and its
            successor, Final Fantasy Tacttics, in both tone and gameplay.
             However, it is better than either of those, in my opinion.
              It discards the emphasis on customizability in favor of
              highly distinct units that all provide something unique,
           and its Conviction system leads to no playthrough being the same.
           Now, try to guess: Which of these is NOT a Conviction in the game?
