            Fire Emblem has grown into the flagship SRPG series, selling millions of copies ever since Fire Emblem: Awakening.
                Each game is very different, but most of them (since the series moved to Gameboy Advance) emphasize speed,
              with enemy and ally units both being defeated typically within 2-5 attacks. Older entries lack customizability,
             at least in comparison to many other SRPGs, but I personally like this because it makes each character feel real.
                                 Now, try to guess: Which of these Fire Emblems sold the most copies?
