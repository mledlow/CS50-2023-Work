Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I thought there would be more distance between 10/100/1000.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

10000 because anything after that is a notable time lag, 100000 at most.
